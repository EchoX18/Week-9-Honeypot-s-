Week 9 HoneyPot Deployment
# Project 9 - HoneyPot

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

# Honeypots Delpoyed
* The honeypots that I deployed were three instances of Dionaea. And one instance of Ubantu Snort.
* I used the Google Cloud Platform to launch these instances.

#Issues Encountered 
* One big issue that I encountered while doing this assignment was accessing the site after I had created MHN. I realized that the site was alive but it was not responding to http requests. I had to go back and open up the TCP port to allow responsive HTTP requests.
* Another issue that I had was using hurricane labs, after initally cloning for that instance I was founded with a variety of bugs.
