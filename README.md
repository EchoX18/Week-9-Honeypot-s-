Week 9 HoneyPot Deployment
# Project 9 - HoneyPot

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total  Honeypots launched 11/19 data collected end of day 11/21

# Honeypots Delpoyed
* The honeypots that I deployed were three instances of Dionaea. And one instance of Ubantu Snort.
* I used the Google Cloud Platform to launch these instances.

# Issues Encountered 
* One big issue that I encountered while doing this assignment was accessing the site after I had created MHN. I realized that the site was alive but it was not responding to http requests. I had to go back and open up the TCP port to allow responsive HTTP requests.
* Another issue that I had was using hurricane labs, after initally cloning for that instance I was founded with a variety of bugs.

# Summary of collected Data
* Below I will be discussing and summarizing the result that I have found in the past few days running the honeypots.

# Number of Attacks
* Within the last few days my honeypot has been attacked a total of 24,988 times. Most of them come on the platforms of Dionaea. Snort was only run for about 12 hours and has only gained around 30 attacks. 
* The United States were amoung the highest to attack the honeypots

# Number of Malware Samples
* I have recieve many malware sample and payloads one of the highest was ET DROP Dshield Block Listed Source group 1. It was very common, one of the things I noticed was many of these were coming from Public IP addresses. The second was GPL SNMP public access udp.
* To conclude the summary, the dionaea was the most attack possibly because it was the easiest to target or the most common one to attack. Snort was very slow in attacks and had very few compared to Dionaea in the relative time that it was running. 

# Unresolved Question 
* I didn't truly have any unresolved questions besides the question of why is the Canada and the United States the highest in attacks I have recieved? They were the most common. 
* I will be uploading screen shots of the Honeypot that include the payloads and the top attacks that the honeypot recieved. 
* Thank you for reading this information study that I have conducted.
